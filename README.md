# Contract signatories

In OCDS, the signatories to the contract are not explicitly declared in the `contracts` section. Instead, the signatories are implicitly assumed to be the `buyer` and the `suppliers` in the award associated to the contract.

In some types of contracting processes, there can be additional signatories to the contract, or the signatories to the contract can differ from those specified in `buyer` and `suppliers`.  This extension adds a `contracts.signatories` array to specify the signatories.

Use this extension **only if** the signatories to a contract differ from its related award's `suppliers` and the contracting process' `buyer`. If that is the case, list all signatories to the contract, including the `buyer` and `suppliers`.

## Example

The following JSON snippet models a contracting process where there is an additional signatory to the contract beyond those defined in the `buyer` and `awards.suppliers` fields.

```json
{
  "buyer": {
    "name": "Ministry of Communications",
    "id": "GB-GOV-12345678"
  },
  "awards": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "suppliers": [
        {
          "name": "Example Consortium",
          "id": "GB-COH-00000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "contracts": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "awardID": "1",
      "signatories": [
        {
          "name": "Ministry of Communications",
          "id": "GB-GOV-12345678"
        },
        {
          "name": "Example Consortium",
          "id": "GB-COH-00000000"
        },
        {
          "name": "Telecommunications UK",
          "id": "GB-GOV-99999999"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage notes

Each signatory to the contract should have an associated entry in the `parties` section of OCDS.

This extension follows the approach to modelling organizations introduced in OCDS V1.1.
