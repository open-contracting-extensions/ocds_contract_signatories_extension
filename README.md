# Contract signatories

## Background

In OCDS, the signatories to the contract are not explicitly declared in the `contracts` section. Instead, the signatories are implicitly assumed to be the `buyer` (`publicAuthority` in the PPP extension) and the `suppliers` in the award associated to the contract (`preferredBidders` in the PPP extension).

In some types of contracting processes, there can be additional signatories to the contract, or the signatories to the contract can differ from those specified in `buyer` (`publicAuthority`) and `suppliers` (`preferredBidders`). Use this extension only in such circumstances.

## Extension fields

This extension adds a `signatories` property to the `contracts` section. The `signatories` property is an array of `OrganizationReference`'s.

## Example

The following JSON snippet models a contracting process where there is an additional signatory to the contract beyond those defined in the `buyer` and `awards.suppliers` fields.

```json
{
  "buyer": {
    "name": "Ministry of Communications",
    "id": "GB-GOV-12345678"
  },
  "awards": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "suppliers": [
        {
          "name": "Example Consortium",
          "id": "GB-COH-00000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "contracts": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "awardID": "1",
      "signatories": [
        {
          "name": "Ministry of Communications",
          "id": "GB-GOV-12345678"
        },
        {
          "name": "Example Consortium",
          "id": "GB-COH-00000000"
        },
        {
          "name": "Telecommunications UK",
          "id": "GB-GOV-99999999"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage notes

Each signatory to the contract should have an associated entry in the `parties` section of OCDS.

This extension follows the approach to modelling organizations introduced in OCDS V1.1.
